# Amazon-Employee

It is a classification problem. Employees are manually allowed or denied access to resources overtime. amazon data to predict apporval/denial for an unseen set of employees.Here im using 2 algorithms one is CatBoostClassifier and LogisticRegression. Do some visualization and some data preprocessing. And the dataset is imbalanced. and to deal with that i used random upsampling techniques.The CatBoost algorithm give good accuracy and LogisticRegression accuracy is bad.
